# TrafficSense AI
 An intelligent traffic management system that makes use of Canny Edge Detection and sophisticated image processing to dynamically optimize signal timings and assess traffic density, guaranteeing more intelligent and seamless urban traffic flow.
TrafficSense AI is an innovative traffic management system designed to revolutionize urban mobility. By harnessing the power of advanced computer vision and AI-driven Canny Edge Detection, the system analyzes real-time traffic density from images and videos. It intelligently calculates white pixel counts, representing vehicle density, and dynamically adjusts signal timings to optimize traffic flow.

This state-of-the-art solution ensures that high-density traffic areas receive longer green signal durations while low-density zones are allocated shorter intervals. The result is reduced congestion, minimized travel time, and improved fuel efficiency, contributing to a more sustainable and efficient urban environment.

Whether managing static images or live video feeds, TrafficSense AI adapts seamlessly to varying traffic conditions, making it ideal for modern cities striving to achieve smarter, eco-friendly transportation systems. By integrating cutting-edge algorithms with practical applications, TrafficSense AI offers a future-ready approach to solving one of the biggest challenges of urban livingâ€”traffic congestion.
